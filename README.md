- Power Query (Data Cleaning & Transformation)  
- Power Pivot (Data Modeling & Relationships)  
- DAX Measures  
- Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts  
- KPI Cards  
- VBA Macros (Refresh Automation)

## 🔄 Data Preparation (Power Query)

Using Power Query:

- Removed duplicate records  
- Handled missing/null values  
- Standardized data types  
- Created calculated columns  
- Structured raw data for reporting  

This ensured accurate and reliable analysis.

---

## 🔗 Data Modeling (Power Pivot)

- Created relationships between tables  
- Built calculated measures using DAX  
- Developed KPI metrics for business reporting  

### Example DAX Measures:
- Total Claims  
- Total Paid Amount  
- Total Adjustments  
- Denial Rate %

Power Pivot improved performance and enabled scalable analysis.

## 🔘 VBA Automation – Refresh Button

A dedicated Refresh Button was implemented using VBA Macros.

When clicked, it:

- Refreshes all Power Query connections  
- Updates the Power Pivot Data Model  
- Refreshes all Pivot Tables  
- Syncs slicers and timeline filters  
- Ensures the dashboard reflects latest data instantly  

This eliminates manual refresh steps and simulates real-world reporting automation.
